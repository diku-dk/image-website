[Piab](https://www.piab.com) provides vacuum technologies for lifting and moving objects in automation applications. The lab space has received a package of vacuum cups and soft grippers that may suit different payloads and object geometries. The grippers can be connected to robot arms such as [UR5e](./ur5e) and actuated with vacuum ejector (the red aspirator in the picture) or piCOMPACT I/O link (the device in the picture). Note you might need air compressor as in the picture below and pneumatic valves to control on/off of the grip. Consult the lab manager on how to use them properly.
