# The Robotlab 
DIKUs Robotlab is the place for experimenting with robotics of all kinds.

Our robot lab has a growing assortment of different robotics platforms. Notably a number of robot arms, grippers, ground and aerial mobile platforms. 
The lab is also equipped with an optitrack motion capture system for tracking robot movements.

The lab should be used primarily for testing robotics platforms so any repair work etc. should be done in the [toolshop](/image-website/toolshop/).

__the UR5e:__ the [UR5e]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link robotlab/ur5e.md %}) is a cobot and as such it is much safer than the standard industrial robot. It is still a potentially dangerous (and definitely expensive) machine, so make sure you have received the mandatory safety instructions before using this. The robots will be used in a MSc course in block 4 so be prepared when using them.

__OnRobot RG2:__ the [OnRobot RG2]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link robotlab/rg2gripper.md %}) is eletric two-fingered gripper that can be mounted on UR5e to grasp and release objects.

__Piab Pneumatic Gripper Kit:__ the [Piab Pneumatic Gripper Kit]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link robotlab/piabgripper.md %}) is a set of vacuum ejector, suction cups and soft grippers for grasping and releasing objects. You may need to use them together with compressors and valves in the lab. 

__uFactory xArm6:__ [xArm6]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link robotlab/xarm6.md %}) is a light-weight cobot with similar degrees-of-freedom and payload as UR5e. It is possible to use above grippers although they are not natively supported. Read the detailed instruction or contact the lab manager to find a solution for using an end-effector. 

__The Arlos:__ Arlo is an open landdrone platform for teaching and research. We have app. 10 Arlos. These are used in the robot course and thus it should be respected that in block 1 they are reserved for this purpose. This also means that there will be significntly more activity in the lab in this period, so plan ahead.

__TerraBot:__ [TERRA]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link robotlab/terrabot.md %}) is a home-made differential-drive mobile platform similar to the Arlos. Ask the owner or the lab manager for its availability if you found its features suit your project better.

__Crazyflies:__ the crazyflies are micro-sized drones that can be used for projects, but it should be noted that they are fragile, and even though we have 8 of them and some spare parts, please be cautious when using them.

__Moption Capture system:__  [Optitrack]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link robotlab/optitrack.md %}) system consist of 8 cameras positioned to give a good coverage of the entire lab, centered on the middle of the floor. Do not under any circumstances move any of the cameras. They will have to be re calibrated and can be potentially damaged if moved. The lab space at Sigursgade has a similar system used for research on human interaction. 



If you want to use any of the robots for a project, contact the lab manager....
